* Teresa of Avila wrote *The Way to Perfection,* which describes the ascent of the soul to union with the Holy Spirit.

* El Greco painted the *Resurrection,* which includes distinct mannerist qualities and is decorous to the extent that draperies carefully conceal all inappropriate nudity.

  3. presenting the narrative in a solemn style free form affectation
