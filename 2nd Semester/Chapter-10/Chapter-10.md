# The Counter-Reformation and Baroque

* Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina served as choirmaster at the Capella Giulia in the Vatican and composed the *Mass for Pope Marcellus.*

* The term *braghettoni* was assigned to those who painted draperies over the "offensive" areas of the nude figures in Michelangelo's *Last Judgement.*

* Correggio created *Jupiter and Io* as part of the set of paintings commissioned by Frederico Gonzaga of Mantua.

* Jupiter appears to Io in the painting commissioned by Federico Gonzaga of Mantua as a cloud.

* Teresa of Avila wrote *The Way to Perfection,* which describes the ascent of the soul to union with the Holy Spirit.

* El Greco painted the *Resurrection,* which includes distinct mannerist qualities and is decorous to the extent that draperies carefully conceal all inappropriate nudity.

* The characteristics mentioned as "innovative" qualities of *Don Quixote:*
  1. Using everyday speech in dialogue
  2. Creating vivid and complex portraits of the main and subordinate characters
  3. presenting the narrative in a solemn style free form affectation
  4. In delicate juxtaposition with the comic scenes.
