* Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina served as choirmaster at the Capella Giulia in the Vatican and composed the *Mass for Pope Marcellus.*

* The term *braghettoni* was assigned to those who painted draperies over the "offensive" areas of the nude figures in Michelangelo's *Last Judgement.*

* Correggio created *Jupiter and Io* as part of the set of paintings commissioned by Frederico Gonzaga of Mantua.
