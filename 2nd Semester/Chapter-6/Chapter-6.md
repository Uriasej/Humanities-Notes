# The Gothic and the Rebrith of Naturalism

* Cartres was considered the center of the cult of the Virgin throughout the twelfth and thirteenth centuries.

* The tunic Mary wore at Jesus' birth was considered the most cherished relic at the Chartres Cathedral.

* The chief purpose of the stained-glass programs in all Gothic cathedrals was to tell the stories of the Bible.

* One of the stained-glass windows at the Chartres Cathedral shows the genealogy of Christ. The window called "*Tree of Jesse*" depicts the
  Virgin Mary as descended from Jesse, the father of King David, Thus fulfilling the prophecy in the book of Isaiah.

* In a gothic church, the flying buttress was traditionally built against an exterior wall to provide support for more windows and brace it against strong winds.

* The Figure of Saint Theodore found on the jamb of Chartres' south transept portal stands in a contrapposto position.
