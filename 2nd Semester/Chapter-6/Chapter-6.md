* The tunic Mary wore at Jesus' birth was considered the most cherished relic at the Chartres Cathedral.

* The chief purpose of the stained-glass programs in all Gothic cathedrals was to tell the stories of the Bible.

  Virgin Mary as descended from Jesse, the father of King David, Thus fulfilling the prophecy in the book of Isaiah.

* In a gothic church, the flying buttress was traditionally built against an exterior wall to provide support for more windows and brace it against strong winds.
